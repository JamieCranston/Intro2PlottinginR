This repository contains materials I made for my Learning and Teaching in Higher Education Assesment, peer observed teach.  
The materials were made to help me deliver a 45 minute sessions entitled "Data Visualisation: theory and practice" to my research group meeting.   
The Research group is a mixed ability audience, consisting of lecturers, postgraduates and undergraduates.  
I have uploaded my first talk draft here which I delivered in the first session and also a second version which represents the version I would deliver if I gave the talk again having reflected on the session and the feedback I was given.  
I have also included the anonymised feedback I received and my reflections.  
Hopefully, this may be useful to anyone else who is doing LTHE assessment and represents an opportunity for me to share the good practice and areas for development I discovered in my teach.  
Alternatively, It may just be useful if you want to learn a little more about ggplot2.  
Thanks,  
Jamie
